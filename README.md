Usage
-----

__Installing__

The first step with the plugin is to drop it into your plugins folder!
When the plugin is first run. It will generate a config file you can edit!

The config file is very very simple. You can modify the values in it to change the costs of the runes!

__Info on runes cost__

The runes cost gold nuggets to cast them to provide a sense of balance.

Players in creative mode can bypass this cost.

__Getting the rune wand__

To get the rune wand. Use /addwand to add it to your inventory.
Or /addwand <Player> to add it to someone elses inventory.

The rune wand is what you use to cast your runes.
You can select runes on it by sneaking and left/right clicking.
Once you have selected a rune, you left/right click to cast it.

__Information on runes__

All runes are cast at the location you right click, however some runes like to be placed within 10 blocks of you.

The runes are as follows

__Defense:__ The damage players receive while inside this rune is minimized!

__Exploding:__ The rune will explode after so and so seconds!

__Healing:__ You are healed every so and so seconds!

__Teleport:__ A rune is placed at your location and the destination. After a short wait, the teleport becomes active.

__Trap:__ A rune is placed and hidden on the ground. Anything stepping on that rune will activate it with a explosion!

__Wither Summoning:__ I got bored. This draws a pentagram on the ground, once finished. I use the blood of mbaxter to activate it.

__Speed:__ Step in this to gain a speed II boost for 5 minutes!

__Hiding:__ Step in here to hide from other players and monsters while the rune lasts!
